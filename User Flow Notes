Q's for Justin
- Will a user be creating their own profile, or is the administrator in charge of that?
- Will the administrator have access to editing Staff information? / What level of editable content does administrator have with staff profile? 
- Will a rider/client get a notification for scheduling a next appointment? is that something that will be called in rather than through the app?
- Will staff have viewership of dashboard content? (could they edit anything?)
- do the To Dos relate to the Schedule directly? or are To Dos and Schedule separate items?
- Would the "Approve time off" option fit better within a Schedule page, Dashboard page, it's own page (a combination of multiple pages)?
- if a therapist calls in sick at the last minute, does that cancel the appointment? as opposed to a walker / handler calling in sick last minute, are they just replaced?
- do riders have a regular walkers / handler / horse / staff? or is the therapist the only constant?


Misc Notes
- To-Dos get their own page / section of app (maybe on a dashboard?)
- Admin has access (but isn't responsible) for editing Profile information?
- Admin dashboard will contain To-dos, Training, and Notes, ALL (admin, staff, (volunteers?)) see Events/Birthdays/Cancelation days (like if one day is rained out)
- Combining To Dos and Schedules (having the option to add To Dos to the Schedule)
- schedule editing options include staff & volunteers who are available at that time slot
