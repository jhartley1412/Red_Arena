	<h1>Typography</h1>
	<h2>Headings</h2>
	<p>Bitter, a slab serif font, offers an approachable, personality-filled style, which is a nice juxtaposition with the more formal sans-serif. Accordingly, Bitter is used to introduce sections of content on the site and is exclusively reserved for major headlines. The intent is for the consumer to be attracted initially to these welcoming headlines. Once we have their attention, we can draw them into the details with the highly-legible sans-serif. Headers should be 18 pixels or 1.125em in size.</p>

	<div class="paragraphs">
	<h2> Paragraphs/Body</h2>
	
	<p>Paragraphs will all be Work Sans. Work Sans provides clarity when reading accross all various screen sizes. Paragraphs should not exceed 5 columns in length on the 12 column grid at the desktop size. Headers should be 16 pixels or 1em in size. The height of body text is 33.333333 pixels or 2.083 ems</p>
