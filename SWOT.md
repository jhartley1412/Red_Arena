SWOT Analysis - Red Arena



Strengths;
    - treat horses better than competitors (they only work a set number of days a week, only one back-to-back sessions a day)
    - most workers are volunteers (and have a passion for what it is they're doing)
    - "family" community amongst staff and volunteers and employees (makes working there more "enjoyable" and encourages harder workers)

Weaknesses;
    - primarily based outdoors (schedules dependent on the weather)
    - only about 9 horses; less horses to cycle through, in case one or more get sick or can't work on day
    - younger volunteers (volunteers specifically) has potential to equal lazier workers, kids only looking to get volunteer hours
    - (on their website alone) a competing organization has a page dedicated to bios of their horses (allowing potential customers to "be involved" in their community)


Opportunities;
    - being primarily outdoors, outdoor events are options to bring in more popularity
    - horses provide riding opportunities for lessons and extra income

Threats;
    - There are other Horse Riding Therapy based organizations in the Austin area
    - dependent on grant money / state money
