3 Personas
------------


1) Kathy Anderson
    40-something year old mom. Has 3 kids at home, works at a home office most days. She dedicates about 3-4 hours a week to Red Arena, as a volunteer Horse Handler/Side Walker. She grew up on a farm and has almost a lifetimes worth of experience with animals (especially horses). Her youngest has autism, and frequents the Red Arena when he can, the other two enjoys the riding camps in the summer, when she has more time to spend at the Arena. She double-checks her schedule for her hours every morning (just to make sure!) and loves to help out best she can with whatever needs being done. 

2) Hubert Mohnagan
    52yr old man. Never married, but has a few dogs at home. He works as a staff member to help pay the bills, but his real passion is painting landscapes (horses make for great scenery elements). Before working at the Red Arena, he never had any farmyard/animal experience, but was always a real "go-getter," and an eager learner. Being a responsible staff member, Hubert likes to check his schedule at the beginning of the week, and plan his time accordingly. He likes to spend his hours off painting the scenery at the ranch and surrounding areas.


3) Harold Hadrata
    Harold is a 17 year old second generation American. He is starting to apply to colleges and knows Volunteering a a non-profit will look good on his application. He has never had to work around animals before, but is excited to learn all that he can. he can only work 3 days a week but that is subject to change depending on his weekly course load at school. He mostly enjoys playing rugby with his friends after school with his friends. He is a very large for his age at 6'2". Harold is fairly tech savy and can normally figure out most computer systems pretty quickly. He is very nervous about working with special needs people, but feels he is up to the challenge. What he is really interested in is learning about and how to care for horses as he hopes one day to be a veterinarian.
